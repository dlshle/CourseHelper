<h1>Course Helper</h1>
This is a very simple program that helps you find the least time conflict schedule for you.
<br>
HowTo:
<br>
First, you want to find all the courses with all available sections you want to take for the next semester first, and then pack them in a file.
<br>
Then, load the file with the program, and it will search almost all the combination cases for you and eliminate the conflicts between sections. It should return the least time conflict schedule for you.
<br>
Check if the result is correct, and if not, report the bug to me(Thank you!).
