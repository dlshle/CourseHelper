<h1>Course Helper</h1>
This is a very simple program that helps you choose the most time efficient courses.
<br>
HowTo:
<br>
First, you want to find all the courses with all available sections you want to choose first, and then pack them in a file.
<br>
Then, load the file with the program, and it will search the best combination for you.
<br>
Check if the result is correct, and if not, report the bug to me(Thank you!).
